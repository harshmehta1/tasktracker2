Design choices made:
1. Description is of type text, as I like to think there should not be a limit on the description, since tasks can be assigned to other users, the description of tasks can be detailed and often long.
2. Another design decision I made was to have two input fields for hours and minutes for ease of use as well as limiting inputs to 15 minute increments.
3. Added unique constraint for emails as two users should not have the same email ID.
4. Once user has logged in, he can no longer see the Log In page until he logs out.
5. If a user is not logged in, he cannot check the task feed.
6. Only the user who the task is assigned to can edit/delete the task.
7. Users cannot edit details of other users.
8. Once task is completed, it can not be edited.
9. A logged in user has two choices to create new task, one a form on the top of the task feed and two through the new task button. I did this as someone who wants to create a single task quickly can use the task feeds form and if someone wants to create and work on multiple tasks, they can open it in new tabs.
10. Users have the option of seeing a general task feed (all tasks) or a custom one (my task feed), wherein they only have option to edit and delete tasks in the my task feed.
11. I have also given the option to edit profile where users can change their profile details.
12. Completed tasks on task feeds are color coded as green and cannot be edited.
